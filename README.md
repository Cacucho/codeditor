Offline MediaWiki Code Editor is a freeware offline application for those WindowsÂ® users who want to edit articles in Wikipedia or other projects of the Wikimedia Foundation (Wiktionary, Wikibooks, etc).

It includes tools and assistants with a simple and intuitive user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) which helps the user to generate much of the MediaWiki code with a minimum of effort. The edition is carried out in plain text with Unicode UTF-8 codification,

The application makes easier and faster the edition of articles, even if you do not have previous knowledge of the markup rules. It helps you to prevent mistakes during the process of edition, so you can pay much more attention to the content than to sintax.

Although the application program was designed for users with no previous knowledge of the MediaWiki language, it is also useful for experts, once it saves time and reduces the possibility of typing errors.

Both the installer and the application interface are available in the most common used languages in Wikipedia: English, Spanish, French and German. As it does not require permanent internet access, you can make use of this application anywhere and anytime. This is an advantage for those wikipedians who have limited access to internet. But, even if you are working online, you still can take advantage of this simple application.

Another interesting advantage is the possibility to test part of your code offline in your default web browser. This tests simulate the behavior that would show the wiki code in Wikipedia. To perform this simulation, the editor executes a converter which translates the wikicode to HTML, which in turn is reproduced offline in your browser window. This conversion is performed by the free third-party software Pandoc. Thus, you can make the necessary corrections before uploading your code to Wikipedia.
